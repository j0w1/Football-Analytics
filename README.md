# Football Analytics
This repository is dedicated to the exploration of football data through code. Here, you'll find different folders with Jupyter Notebooks useful to obtain data from [FBREF](https://fbref.com/en/) and [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/es/) (free data).

## Folder Structure

**FBREF**: inside the FBREF folder, you'll discover a Jupyter Notebook that provides a comprehensive guide on scraping data from the five major football leagues.

**StatsBomb**: within the StatsBomb folder, there's a Jupyter Notebook illustrating how to obtain data from StatsBomb's free API.
