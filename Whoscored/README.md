# Whoscored data scraping

This folder contains code that is useful for scraping data from Whoscored. A portion of this code has been extracted from [McKay Johns's](https://github.com/mckayjohns) workshop, and I have added some additional functions to enhance the scraping capabilities.

## Purpose

The main goal of this code is to simplify the process of scraping event data from Whoscored. It provides the tools needed to extract relevant information from the Whoscored website. You can then use this data for analysis and upload it to your own database if you want.
